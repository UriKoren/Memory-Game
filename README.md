## How It Works
The rules are very simple; flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. Each turn:

* A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## What Will I Learn?
I built this game to sharpen my skills in JS, HTML, CSS so that I could learn MERN STUCK more easily so it was like a prep project for me.
